# Portfolio Website
====================

Welcome to my portfolio website! Here, you can explore the projects I've been working on and see how my skills have grown.

All projects will be shown here and briefly explained.

### What I want to implement 
* Picture of project/output 
* Summary of how long it took (start and end dates) and what I learned
* Showcase the technologies and concepts I learned and used in the project
* Show any extra things I learned and experimented with
* Ability to sort the projects using different filters 

These are features I'm planning to add in the future, so stay tuned!

## Games 
------
### Battleships (active) 

This project is written in C++
Here you can find **[Battleships](https://github.com/smile3io/Battleships "bum bam splash")**.

> ### What i have learned 
> * **Vectors:** Used `std::vector` to efficiently store and manage the ships' locations and the game board.
> * **Maps:** Implemented `std::map` to manage the menu with it's text and actions based on the input.
> * **Pairs:** Utilized `std::pair` to represent coordinates on the game board, making it easy to work with row and column values together.
> * **Object-oriented programming:** Practiced object-oriented principles by creating classes for `Player`, `Ship`, and `Settings` to structure the game logic.

## Simulations
-----------
### Coming Soon!

I'm planning to explore AI simulations in this section.

> ### What i have learned 
> This project is still in the planing stage.

Render engine 
-------------
### Coming Soon!

Here, I'll be working on a basic game renderer to understand graphics.
